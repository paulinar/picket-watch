============

Picket Watch is both a Toq smart watch app and an Android app that supports collaborative, location based, poster creation activityâ€”inspired by the 50th anniversary of the Free Speech Movement (FSM).

Example use case: a user walks across Sproul Plaza in Berkeley wearing the Toq Watch and carrying their Android phone. Their watch vibrates and presents a notification stating to draw the text corresponding to a random historical figure involved in the 1963 Free Speech Movement. These historical figures are: Mario Savio, Jack Weinberg, Joan Baez, Michael Rossman, Art and Jackie Goldberg.
